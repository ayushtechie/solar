          EPC refers to Engineering, procurement and civil construction. In the solar industry, EPC companies are those who provide a one-stop solution for everything solar. With that, you donâ€™t have to go to multiple vendors to assemble numerous components of a solar plant, EPC providers do that job for you. It is crucial for the successful installation of a solar power plant, especially when it is a large-scale project in MW.

        These three components of EPC are essential well-connected pillars of a successful solar power plant. They take care of the complete lifespan of a project. So, industries have to be very careful in choosing the right one, as it will be a long-term partnership of 25 years. The EPCs should be skilled, resourceful, dedicated and professional in their approach.
